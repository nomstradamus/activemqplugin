Sample plugin for activemq

This repository describes how you can create a plugin in activemq.

I have deliberately kept the tutorial short and simple . 

Just clone the repo. 
Add the jar to the lib folder in activemq.
Modify your activemq.xml or you may even choose to use mine.
Start your activemq and the plugin should print some output once you try to connect to the broker using a sample producer or consumer.
